    <description>FluentMigrator is a database migration framework for .NET written in C#. The basic idea is that you can create migrations which are simply classes that derive from the Migration base class and have a Migration attribute with a unique version number attached to them. Upon executing FluentMigrator, you tell it which version to migrate to and it will run all necessary migrations in order to bring your database up to that version.
  In addition to forward migration support, FluentMigrator also supports different ways to execute the migrations along with selective migrations called profiles and executing arbitrary SQL.</description>
    <releaseNotes>Newly added description feature was declared in the Migration as String(int.MaxValue), which caused issues on some processors like MySqlProcessor because of missing type map or just not possible. We've changed the migration so it now declares it as : AsString(1024) which should cause no issues. Even if you where using 1.1.2 before on a supported db like for instance SqlServer.

    From now on even if you don't provide a description in your migration attribute the description column contains the migration class name.</releaseNotes>
